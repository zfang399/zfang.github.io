              <p>I proposed a novel Non-Instrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) method for load identification and energy disaggregation 
                based on Bayes Nonparametric Learning and lightweight appliance-specific LSTM networks. This work was done during my
                internship at Argonne National Laboratory.</p>

                <li>
                  <p>Designed a simple but effective event pre-processing technique that based on the idea of "velocity" in pose prediction
                    to reduce complexity of network training and make the proposed method robust to multi-appliance scenarios.

                <li>
                  <p>Proposed to use appliance-specific networks for more accurate load state classification, where each network focuses
                    on one type of appliance and is much easier to train than a huge composite network.</p>

                <li>
                  <p>Adapted well-established techniques such as Bayes Nonparametric Learning and SMOTE: Synthetic Minority Over-sampling

              <p>We proposed the first presentation attack detection (PAD) algorithm based on three-dimensional features

                  <p> Designed the photometric stereo-based PAD algorithm based on the observation that the shadows are different when real irises and
